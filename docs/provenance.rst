.. _provenance:

Provenance
==========

Layers
------

We may consider three different layers regarding provenance in the context of scientific workflows:

1. The definition of the workflow with a workflow management system (*logical provenance*).
2. The provenance of the data, i.e. documentation of a specific instance (run) of the workflow (*data provenance*).
3. Searchable archive/database containing (several) instances of the workflow(s) (*FAIRness*). 

Between layer 2. and 3. there may be an overlap, but not necessarily.
Regarding layer 3. below we would like to collect questions/queries that should
be able to be answered by such an archive/database.

Questions/Queries
-----------------

What must be queryable?

1. Which of the workflows involve a finite element analysis?
2. Which of the workflows make use of a certain software package/tool (+version constraint)?
