.. _usera:
User A
------

Writes application code on top of well-established open-source software libraries
to tackle domain-specific problems. Moreover, User A writes scripts for pre-
and post-processing of input/output data. The written code is domain- and
project-specific and does not have substantial potential for reusability.

.. _userb:
User B
------

Helps in the development and maintenance of an open-source software framework.
User B's research activities involve the development of new algorithms, which are
implemented into the framework in the scope of research projects, and which are
presented to the community in the form of scientific papers. The content presented
in the papers is produced by separate application code that runs a series of tests.

.. _userc:
User C
------

In the scope of a research project, user C writes application-specific code.
During the development, it becomes clear that a major part of the implemented
functionality could be useful for the community in various contexts. User C then
decides to separate the generic parts of the code into a standalone framework,
while moving the project-specific parts into an applications module.
